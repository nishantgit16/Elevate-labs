 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification - Iris Dataset

📌 Objective

Implement and explain K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification on the Iris dataset using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

📂 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates the complete process of applying KNN classification to the Iris dataset, including:

Data loading and exploration

Handling missing values and cleaning

Detecting and managing outliers for stability

Feature normalization (critical for KNN)

Model training with various values of k

Model evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix

Decision boundary visualization for feature pairs

📊 Dataset Description

Iris DatasetThe classic Iris dataset contains flower measurements for three species:

Features:

Sepal length (cm)

Sepal width (cm)

Petal length (cm)

Petal width (cm)

Target:

Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

Total samples: 150

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks

⚙️ Step-by-Step Process

Data Import & InspectionLoaded the dataset and performed basic exploration.

Outlier HandlingDetected and addressed outliers to improve model robustness.

Feature NormalizationApplied StandardScaler to standardize features (KNN is distance-based, scaling is critical).

Train-Test SplitSplit the data for reliable model evaluation.

KNN Model TrainingTrained KNeighborsClassifier and experimented with different values of k.

Model EvaluationEvaluated performance using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Decision Boundary VisualizationVisualized decision regions for various feature pairs to understand model behavior.

📈 Key Insights

Proper scaling significantly impacts KNN performance.

Choosing the right k balances bias-variance trade-off.

Visualizing decision boundaries helps interpret model decision-making.
