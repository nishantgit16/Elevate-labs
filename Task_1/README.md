💺 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Preprocessing

Overview

This project involves a complete EDA and preprocessing pipeline on the Titanic dataset, aimed at preparing the data for machine learning tasks. The notebook Task1.ipynb includes:

✅ Data cleaning and feature removal✅ Univariate and multivariate visualizations✅ Missing value imputation✅ Outlier detection and handling✅ Feature engineering✅ Feature scaling

📁 Contents

Task1.ipynb: Step-by-step notebook covering:

Data inspection (shape, info, describe)

Dropping irrelevant features (PassengerId, Name)

Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Handling missing values

Detecting and treating outliers

Engineering new features for better model performance

Scaling features for machine learning

🗂️ Dataset
